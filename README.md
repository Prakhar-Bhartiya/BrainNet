# Biometric Liveness Detection using EEG Data

In this project we built an android application which was able to solve the issue of biometric liveness detection from an EEG dataset.

Keywords â€”- *Mobile Computing, Machine
Learning, EEG, sensors, Android Application, Biometric*

## Features
- Designed and deployed an Android application for biometric liveness detection.
- Integrated EEG data for biometric verification.
- Used **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**, **Autoencoders**, and **feature extraction** techniques.
- Achieved **98% accuracy** in detecting biometric liveness.
- Models Evaluated - Logistic Regression, K-Means, SVM, KNN.
- Features Evaluated - Alpha + Beta + Delta Band, Power Spectral Density, Coiflets
